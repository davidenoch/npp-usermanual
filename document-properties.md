A document has certain characteristics in the way it's stored on your hard-disk. These following subjects control some of those aspects.

Note: both the default Newline format and the encoding of new files can be set, see New document settings for more details.

The current properties of a document, like its character count, selection statistics and such, are available through the View -> Summary.



which contains the following information:

* Fully qualified active document path
* Creation date
* Last modification date
* Byte size of document
* Character count of the document, blanks excluded
* Character count of the document
* Line count
* Size of selection (characters, bytes and ranges)

Note that the character count and byte count are not a function of each other in UTF-8 (see Encoding).
